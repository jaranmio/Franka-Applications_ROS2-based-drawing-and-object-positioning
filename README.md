---

### 1. üß∞ Open a Terminal

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open a new terminal window.

---

### 2. üöÄ Launch the FR3 Move Group with MoveIt2

```sh
ros2 launch franka_fr3_moveit_config moveit.launch.py robot_ip:=172.16.0.2
```

This launches:
- The FR3 robot model
- RViz2 for visualization
- MoveIt2 motion planning server

Wait until RViz fully loads and displays the robot.

---

### 3. ‚ûï Open a Second Terminal Tab

    ```sh
    cd /home/qpaig/my_ros2_ws/src/fr3_generic_drawing
    code .
    ```
  - For raster: Edit `const double DRAWING_HEIGHT = ...;` and `const double CONVERSION_FACTOR = ...;` in `draw_image.cpp`.
  - For vector: Edit corresponding variables in `draw_image_vector.cpp`.

- **Rebuild:**
  ```sh
  cd /home/qpaig/my_ros2_ws
  rm -rf build/ log/ install/
  colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ```

- **Relaunch drawing as in step 11.**

---

### 13. üõë To Stop the Movement

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the fourth terminal.

---

### 14. Note on Robot Restart

- If the arm is restarted, go to a browser and type `172.16.0.2`.
- Unlock the joint brakes and activate FCI.

---

### 15. Selftest

- In the web interface, lock joints, acknowledge, and execute.
- When the blue light is ready, unlock joints and check FCI for drawing mode.

---

### 16. To Change Drawings

- On the desktop, use the `copy_from_here` and `paste_here` folders.
- Copy your image to `paste_here` and rename it to `image.png`.
- Follow step 11 to launch the drawing.

## ü§ñ Pick and Place Instructions

### 1. Launch the Gripper Proxy Node

In a terminal, run:

```sh
ros2 run franka_gripper_proxy proxy_node
```

This node acts as a proxy for gripper actions during pick and place operations.

---

### 2. Configure MoveIt2 to Use the Proxy

1. Navigate to the MoveIt2 configuration folder:

    ```sh
    cd /home/qpaig/franka_ros2_ws/install/franka_fr3_moveit_config/share/franka_fr3_moveit_config/config
    ```

2. Open the file `fr3_controllers.yaml` in a text editor.

3. Change the value of `action_ns` to `moveit_gripper_proxy`:

    ```yaml
    # ...existing code...
    action_ns: moveit_gripper_proxy
    # ...existing code...
    ```

4. Save and close the file.

---

### 3. Launch the Pick and Place Demo

In a terminal, run:

```sh
ros2 launch fr3_pick_and_place pick_and_place.launch.py
```

This will execute a hardcoded pick and place sequence using the FR3 robot.

---

### 4. General ROS2 Launch Instructions

After sourcing your install folder, you can launch any ROS2 project with:

```sh
ros2 launch [project_name] [launch_file_name]
```
or
```sh
